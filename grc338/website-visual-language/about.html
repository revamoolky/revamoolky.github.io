            <h2>Sunny Vibes and Drinks Made Right</h2>
            <p>Southern California: where the sun shines more than 250 days per year and it’s always a good day to go to the beach. Different cultures blend to shape the legendary SoCal vibe. Sunright Tea Studio brings these feelings and ideas together in fresh, delicious drinks and warm experiences that brighten the day of everyone who walks through our door.</p>
            <p>We call ourselves a tea studio because Sunright is more than just a tea shop. We take pride in sourcing the highest quality ingredients and bringing great care and intention to the preparation process. We provide an inviting space to share time with family and friends, a hangout spot for the perfect afternoon tea, and a neighborhood destination where everyone is greeted with a genuine smile. Our creative product line represents the free style of California. </p>
            <h2>Ingredients With Culture and History</h2>
            <p>The sunny theme of Sunright isn’t limited to the atmosphere in our stores. Our tea leaves are cultivated in mountaintop farms, where the plants soak in the essence of the sun and absorb the nourishment of the misty, evening rain. Our master farmers pick the fresh leaves and carefully process them through a variety of methods, including rolling, roasting, and fermentation. The tea is then blended with other tea varietals based on origin, weather, and season, resulting in balanced and consistent flavor.   </p>
